size
 The size attribute should not 
be used on new forms. It was 
used in older forms to indicate 
the width of the text input 
(measured by the number of 
characters that would be seen). 
For example, a value of 3 would 
create a box wide enough to 
display three characters 
(although a user could enter 
more characters if they desired).
 In any new forms you write, 
CSS should be used to control 
the width of form elements. 
The size attribute is only 
mentioned here because you 
may come across it when looking 
at older code.

The <textarea> element 
is used to create a mutli-line 
text input. Unlike other input 
elements this is not an empty 
element. It should therefore have 
an opening and a closing tag.
