Whenever you have many different 
colors in a picture you should use a JPEG. 
A photograph that features snow or an 
overcast sky might look like it has large 
areas that are just white or gray, but the 
picture is usually made up of many different 
colors that are subtly different.

When a picture has an area that is filled 
with exactly the same color, it is known as 
flat color. Logos, illustrations, and diagrams 
often use flat colors. (Note that photographs 
of snow, sky, or grass are not flat colors, 
they are made up of many subtly different 
shades of the same color and are not as 
suited to GIF or PNG format.)

 If the transparent part of the 
image has straight edges and 
it is 100% transparent (that is, 
not semi-opaque), you can save 
the image as a GIF (with the 
transparency option selected).

If the transparent part of the 
image has diagonal or rounded 
edges or if you want a semi
opaque transparency or a drop
shadow, then you will need to 
save it as a PNG.
