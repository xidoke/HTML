The <q> element is used for
shorter quotes that sit within
a paragraph. Browsers are
supposed to put quotes around
the <q> element, however
Internet Explorer does not —
therefore many people avoid
using the <q> element.

In HTML 4 there was a separate 
<acronym> element  for 
acronyms. To spell out the full 
form of the acronym, the title 
attribute was used (as with the 
<abbr> element above). HTML5 
just uses the <abbr> element 
for both abbreviations and 
acronyms.

<cite>
 When you are referencing a 
piece of work such as a book, 
f
 ilm or research paper, the  
<cite> element can be used 
to indicate where the citation is 
from.
 In HTML5, <cite> should not 
really be used for a person's 
name — but it was allowed in 
HTML 4, so most people are 
likely to continue to use it.
 Browsers will render the content 
of a <cite> element in italics.

The <dfn> element is used to 
indicate the defining instance of 
a new term.
 Some browsers show the 
content of the <dfn> element in 
italics. Safari and Chrome do not 
change its appearance.
